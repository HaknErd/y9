## Purpose of a URL
A **URL** *(Uniform Resource Locator)* is a unique identifier that is used to locate and retrieve a specific resource on the web, such as a web page or an image. It typically consists of three parts: the protocol, the domain name, and the path. The protocol specifies how the resource should be retrieved (e.g. HTTP), the domain name identifies the location of the resource (e.g. www.example.com), and the path specifies the specific resource to retrieve (e.g. [/about](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Odin-thor.jpg)).
