## Structure of the Web Graph (Bowtie)
The web graph, also known as the **Bowtie**, is a visual representation of the structure of the World Wide Web. It consists of four main components: the strongly connected core, the in-degree nodes, the out-degree nodes, and the tendrils.



The strongly connected core is the center of the **Bowtie** and represents the most interlinked and well-connected pages on the web. The in-degree nodes are pages that have many incoming links, but few outgoing links. The out-degree nodes are pages with many outgoing links, but few incoming links. The tendrils represent the rest of the web that is not part of the core or the in-degree or out-degree nodes.

## Distinguish between the Surface Web and the Deep Web
The surface web is the portion of the web that is indexed and easily accessible through search engines. It represents only a small fraction of the total web content, estimated to be around 4-5%. The deep web, on the other hand, is the portion of the web that is not indexed by search engines and therefore cannot be found through normal search methods. This includes private web pages, intranet pages, and databases.

## Purpose of a URL
A **URL** *(Uniform Resource Locator)* is a unique identifier that is used to locate and retrieve a specific resource on the web, such as a web page or an image. It typically consists of three parts: the protocol, the domain name, and the path. The protocol specifies how the resource should be retrieved (e.g. HTTP), the domain name identifies the location of the resource (e.g. www.example.com), and the path specifies the specific resource to retrieve (e.g. [/about](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Odin-thor.jpg)).

## Domain Name Server
A domain name server (DNS) is a system that translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate and access web resources on the internet. When a user types a URL into their browser, the DNS system is used to determine the IP address of the server hosting the requested resource, allowing the browser to connect and retrieve the resource.

## Components of a Web Page
A web page typically consists of the following components:
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) - the structure and content of the page
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - the styling and presentation of the page
- JavaScript - the interactive behavior of the page
- Images and media - visual elements on the page
- Text - the written content on the page

## Importance of Protocols and Standards on the Web
Protocols and standards are critical for ensuring that the web works consistently and reliably across different devices and platforms. They define how data should be formatted and transmitted between computers, allowing web pages to be displayed correctly and allowing users to interact with web applications. Some of the most important protocols and standards on the web include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

## Types of Web Pages
Web pages can be broadly categorized into the following types:
- Informational pages - provide information on a particular topic
- E-commerce pages - allow users to purchase goods or services online
- Blog pages - personal or business-related blogs
- Social media pages - allow users to connect and interact with others
- News pages - provide up-to-date news and information

## Static vs. Dynamic Web Pages
Static web pages are pre-written and do not change in response to user actions. They are simple and fast to load, but do not provide dynamic content or interactivity. Dynamic web pages, on the other hand, are generated in real-time in response to user actions. They can provide dynamic content and interactivity, but may be slower to load and more complex to develop.

## Functions of a Browser
A browser is a software application used to access and display web pages. Some of the key functions of a browser include:
- Retrieving and rendering web pages
- Navigating between web pages
- Bookmarking and storing history of visited pages
- Managing cookies and other web storage
- Executing JavaScript code

## How a Search Engine Works
A search engine works by using web crawlers to scan and index web pages, building a database of information about the content and structure of these pages. When a user performs a search, the search engine uses complex algorithms to match the user's query with the information in its database, providing a list of relevant web pages as results.

## Web Crawlers
Web crawlers, also known as spiders, are automated programs that scan and index web pages for search engines. They follow links between web pages, collecting information about the content and structure of each page, and adding it to the search engine's database. This allows search engines to provide more accurate and up-to-date results for user queries.
