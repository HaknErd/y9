## Distinguish between the Surface Web and the Deep Web
The surface web is the portion of the web that is indexed and easily accessible through search engines. It represents only a small fraction of the total web content, estimated to be around 4-5%. The deep web, on the other hand, is the portion of the web that is not indexed by search engines and therefore cannot be found through normal search methods. This includes private web pages, intranet pages, and databases.
